This document contains details on how to setup docker in order to run FIXX

(a) Download the Docker Desktop from one of the following links:
    1. If you are on Windows: Download the Docker Desktop App for Windows using the link https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
    2. If you are on Mac: Download the Docker Desktop App for Mac using the link  
(b) A Dockerfile has been provided in the same folder which contains all the requirements in order to run FIXX
(c) Using the Docker file, run the command <code> docker build -t *docker_image_name*:*tag* . </code>
(d) This step will take a while to finish running
(e) Once the previous step is complete, you will have a docker image created. You can view the list of docker images using docker ps
(f) You will also find the created list of docker images shown on the Docker Desktop App
(i) Simply hit the play button next your container, which will start the container and you can ssh into it
(f) Along with the docker image, you will see a container id (for eg: 29355126ec03) which can be used to ssh into your container
(g) Do <code> docker exec -it *container_id* bash </code> to go into your created docker container
(h) Once inside the docker container, please checkout the main readme.md file in order to begin FIXX analysis
